# win11-start-power-text-renamer
This mod lets you rename the Windows 11 Start menu power options (Lock, Sleep, Shut down, Restart) to any custom text you want. It does not change the layout, icons, or theme—only the displayed text. Useful for personalization, jokes, or clearer wording, while keeping all original power actions working normally.
